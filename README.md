# 1001st_Prime_Euler_Problem_7

We gave a solution from one of the problems of Project Euler.

## Project Description

In this repo, we gave a solution of the seventh problems of Project Euler. The porblem is:

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?

In the "10001st_prime_Euler_Problem_7.ipynb" you will see our solution for the problem, and you can contribute your own as weel.

## Execution

To execute the program, you need to have Python 3.x and an editor. If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly 
recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not
the Python 3.X installer. But you can easily convert it to 3.X.
